The design it's somewhat finished but it can be improved.

Next steps and improvements to do:
-transform the css to make the design mobile first;

-css cleanup and move the generic css attributes of the html tags (general spacings, alignments for design consistency);

-switch from css to scss/sass;

-updates and fixes for the background images (sometimes the background repeats itself and looks horrendous);

-add transition animations for the sliders;

-updates for switcher.js to do the navigation (for example add a "circled-navigation" class or "counted-navigation" class and the switcher would insert the classes and the text or even the whole html part);

-css cleanup for switcher.js to store the generic css related to the slider into switcher.css.
